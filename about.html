        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> To be honest, when asked to explain myself as a developer I'd tell you... I'm still working that out. I've always known being a developer is what I want to pursue as a career, but now that I am in the process of becoming qualified I realise that there is truely a massive expanse of different roles and positions that are equally important within industry. Over the duration of the 10 month CoderAcademy bootcamp I am completing, I am detirmined to narrow that question down to a precise answer, and feel great excitment in doing so and learning every day.
        </p>
        <p> When I'm not coding, you'll probably find I'm getting some exercise in. I like to keep active, so basketball, soccer, mountain biking and gym are among the most frequent hobbies I partake in. When they're on, you can also catch me at any local car shows that are going down, or alternatively at concerts spanning genres like Hip-hop, Rap, and Australian Indie.
        </p>
